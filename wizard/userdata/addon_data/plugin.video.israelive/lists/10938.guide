Quatro amigas. A vida a 900 km/h. Esta é a história de quatro amigas que, apesar da turbulência da vida, nunca deixaram de acreditar no amor…nem em si próprias. Patrícia, Weza, Yara e Weza são quatro melhores amigas, assistentes de bordo, que partilham uma grande amizade entre Portugal e Luanda. Cheias de humor, força e esperança, estas mulheres contam com o apoio incondicional umas das outras, nos altos e baixos das suas vidas. Com a chegada dos 30 anos chegam também novas preocupações, até então adiadas: o casamento, a maternidade e a vida profissional. Confrontadas com as primeiras grandes desilusões e dramas da vida adulta, estas mulheres vão pôr em causa a maneira como até aí tinham pensado as suas vidas… e os homens das suas vidas. Patrícia trabalha numa grande companhia aérea portuguesa há 10 anos, tendo ilustrado até então o estereótipo da hospedeira que enlouquece os homens e brinca com o sexo oposto; sente agora necessidade de assentar e constituir família. Marta é a atriz que nunca conseguiu vingar. Acabada de entrar para uma companhia de voos charter, representa agora pela cabine de um avião numa farda justa e reduzida que odeia, mas exigida pelo regulamento da empresa. Procura realizar o seu sonho de se tornar bem sucedida e de ser levada a sério a nível profissional: Marta é o que Patrícia foi em tempos, rebelde, livre e aventureira. Weza e Yara partilham um apartamento em Luanda. Weza é de origem angolana e trabalha nas linhas aéreas de Angola. Tem um namorado de longa data com o qual tenciona casar num futuro próximo. Mas, ao descobrir que este a traiu, põe um ponto final na relação. O seu desafio será recuperar a confiança perdida no sexo oposto. Yara, angolana, estudou em Portugal com Patrícia, tendo desistido do sonho de um curso superior e ingressado no mundo da aviação quando se viu forçada a regressar a casa, para ajudar o pai após a morte repentina de sua mãe.
