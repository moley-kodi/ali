Ludwig, more commonly known by his nicknames the Swan King or the Dream King, is a legendary figure - the handsome boy-king, loved by his people, betrayed by his cabinet and found dead in tragic and mysterious circumstances. He spent his life in pursuit of the ideal of beauty, an ideal that found expression in three of the most extraordinary, ornate architectural schemes imaginable - the castle of Neuschwanstein and the palaces of Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee. Today, these buildings are among Germany's biggest tourist attractions. Dan argues that Ludwig's castles are more than flamboyant kitsch and are, in fact, the key to unravelling the eternal enigma of Ludwig II."}, {"start": 1447617600, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvprogramme/280985/4996190e7d6a594cb73cf26fddb4d150.jpg", "end": 1447621200, "name": "Mark Lawson Talks to David Hare", "description": "Award-winning writer and director Sir David Hare talks frankly to Mark Lawson following the publication of his much-anticipated memoir The Blue Touch Paper.

Which of the Fab Four's 27 chart-toppers from the UK and the US has been voted the nation's favourite Beatles number one? From She Loves You to Hey Jude, Day Tripper to The Ballad of John and Yoko, and I Want to Hold Your Hand to Let It Be, the programme tells the stories behind some of the band's most enduring hits, which were all written within an eight-year period in the 1960s. The programme hears stories from those who knew the band best, as well as praise from famous fans across the generations - including model Twiggy, ABBA's Bjorn Ulvaeus, singer Sandie Shaw, contemporary singer-songwriters Jake Bugg, George Ezra and Corinne Bailey Rae, musical mastermind Jools Holland, and Manfred Mann's Paul Jones."}, {"start": 1447612200, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvguide/image%2F893906%2F2%2F893906-ITVNewsC-13676361890/poster-240x240.jpg", "end": 1447613100, "name": "ITV News Central", "description": "News headlines from around the region, plus Central weather."}, {"start": 1447613100, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvguide/image%2F556342%2F2%2F556342-ITVNewsa-12744000300/poster-350x257.jpg", "end": 1447614000, "name": "ITV News and Weather", "description": "James Mates presents the latest headlines from around the world.
